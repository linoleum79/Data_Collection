Module 12 Challenge
Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
# Import Splinter and BeautifulSoup
from splinter import Browser
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
import json
browser = Browser('chrome')
Step 1: Visit the Website
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.

Hint To identify which elements to scrape, you might want to inspect the page by using Chrome DevTools.

# Visit the Mars news site
url = 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html'
browser.visit(url)
Step 2: Scrape the Website
Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.

# Create a Beautiful Soup object
mars_soup = soup(browser.html)
# Extract all the text elements
article_items = mars_soup.find_all('div', class_='list_text')
Step 3: Store the Results
Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:

Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary. And, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. An example is the following:

{'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
 'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASA’s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."
}
Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.

Print the list in your notebook.

# Create an empty list to store the dictionaries
article_list = []
# Loop through the text elements
# Extract the title and preview text from the elements
# Store each title and preview pair in a dictionary
# Add the dictionary to the list
for article in article_items:
    title = article.find('div', class_="content_title")
    preview = article.find('div', class_="article_teaser_body")
    
    # if both a title and preview were found, create an dictionary item
    # and add it to the article list
    if (title and preview):
        article_elements = {
            "title": title.text,
            "preview": preview.text
        }

        article_list.append(article_elements)
# Print the list to confirm success
